# WDI
This is an exploratory data analysis of the World Development Indicators dataset. The dataset has a variety of data from different domains such as economic policies of a country, poverty, education, infrastructure and technology, healthcare. The goal was to evaluate performance of countries the best, see if there are certain countries that have significantly been able to change their results and try to find out if any identifiable reasons for that exist. As a goal, I tried to see if there are some controllable factors like government expenditure which generally result in human prosperity or better life quality. I also tried to find out which specific policy decisions, societal norms or perception of people is the difference between developed countries and developing countries. In order to check the overall importance of an indicator in the quality of living in a country, I analyzed developed nations with a focus on US and Canada and their comparison. To find the differentiating factors between developing and developed countries, Iused India as an example of a developing nation. In the end, I did find some indicators that are related to indicators in seemingly other domains. The results could potentially serve as a guide to the actions that can be taken by governments for betterment of quality of life.
